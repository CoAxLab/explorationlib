## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an nice environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project a good experience for everyone, regardless of who they are.

## Our Standards

Don't be an asshole. Seriously.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

Examples of representing a project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. 

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
